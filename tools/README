==============================================================================
This file contains instructions for how to retrieve a Celeste Pico-8 cartridge
and how to extract its relevant contents into a header file for easy inclusion
in our project. For various legal reasons (probably) these extracted contents
should not be checked into this repository.
==============================================================================

First get the cartridge:

> wget https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/cposts/1/15133.p8.png

Then install the Pico-8 cartridge manipulation python library:

> git clone https://github.com/dansanderson/picotool.git
> export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/picotool/ 

And finally run the cartridge extractor:

> ./cartextract.py 15133.p8.png > ../sw/cartridge.h

The previous command my fail complaining that the 'pypng' library is missing in
which case the following command sequence may be useful to install 'pypng' in a
local virtual python environment:

> sudo apt-get install python3-venv
> python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
> python3 -m venv env
> source env/bin/activate
> pip install pypng
